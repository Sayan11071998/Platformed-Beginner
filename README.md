# ***ðŸš€ FirePlatform ðŸ”¥ðŸŽ®***

Iâ€™m excited to finally share the gameplay of my latest project, FirePlatform! Picture this: navigating through blazing fire obstacles, collecting shiny objects, and solving puzzlesâ€”all while trying not to get burned (literally). This game puts your reflexes to the test while challenging your brain with a puzzle or two along the way.

### **ðŸ”¥ What I Learned:**
- **ðŸ”¥ Game Design & Mechanics:** Mastering the movement and rotation of characters to dodge fire and stay alive!
- **ðŸ’» Advanced C++ Programming:** Leveling up my coding skills by implementing complex gameplay mechanics.
- **ðŸŽ¨ Game Level Design:** Crafting immersive levels with fire hazards and hidden objects.
- **ðŸ”¥ Fire Damage & Health System:** Adding a realistic damage system so players take fire damage and need to manage their health strategically.
- **ðŸ§  Puzzle Logic:** Collecting objects and solving puzzles that open or close doorsâ€”because who doesnâ€™t love a good puzzle challenge?
- **ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting & Debugging:** Overcoming technical obstacles to make sure the game runs smoothly.

This project has been an awesome learning experience, giving me the chance to dive deeper into Blueprint concepts and integrate C++ into my game. Iâ€™m really excited about how it turned out, and I canâ€™t wait to keep improving my skills from here!
